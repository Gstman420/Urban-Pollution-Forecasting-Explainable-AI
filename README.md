# Urban Pollution Prediction with Factor Attribution

This project predicts daily air pollution levels using time-series machine
learning techniques. An XGBoost model with lag and rolling-window features
achieves an R² score of 0.94.

The system also uses SHAP to explain which environmental and historical factors
contribute most to pollution levels, improving transparency and trust.

## Key Features
- Time-series forecasting
- Lag and rolling features
- XGBoost regression
- SHAP-based factor attribution

## Results
- R²: 0.94
- MAE: 12.06
- RMSE: 20.54
